Since we don't provide a Makefile at this moment the easiest way to compile the Inquisitor-Engine is to use the Code::Blocks IDE.
A project-file for the Code::Blocks IDE is available and actively maintained.


The Code::Blocks IDE is a cross-platform IDE using WxWidgets.

You further will need the following libraries to succesfully compile the Inquisitor-Engine :
SDL http://www.libsdl.org
FreeImage http://freeimage.sourceforge.net
GLEW http://glew.sourceforge.net
PhysFS http://icculus.org/physfs
